##About

Welcome to the source code of my very first personal website!

My intentions with building this website is to showcase some of my skills and projects. I hope by exploring the website, you are able to learn more about me and maybe my favourite colour. (Hint: It's brown).

## The Code

I tried to build a primarely basic website by just using HTML and CSS. I am by no means a UI/UX expert, so the goal was a simple onepage website built with default HTML libraries.
